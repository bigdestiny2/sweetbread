This adapter was modified from the generic JSON RPC adapter developed by Thomas Hodges.

By changing the url endpoints and the method the adapter is easily modified to use on any blockchain with JSON RPC enabled client. In the case of this project im using the http address of an unlocked Turtlecoin wallet client and the send tx method taken from the Turtlecoin API documentation.
